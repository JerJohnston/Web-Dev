				<h2>The Synopsis</h2>
				<p>Oliver & Company was released on November 18, 1988 by Walt Disney Pictures and produced by Walt Disney Feature Animations. The 27th Disney animated feature film is based on the classic novel written by Charles Dickens, Oliver Twist. The story takes place in New York on fifth avenue, where Oliver is a homeless kitten and meets Dodger and his gang to help him survive on the mean streets. Fagin, a pickpocket in serious debt to loan shark Skyes, sets out with his gang of dogs and Oliver to try and make some money by scheming a rich looking family in a limousine, when Oliver is caught by a little girl.</p>
